Tasty Bytes - Practical Exam Submission

In order to obtain my Data Science Professional Certification from DataCamp, I had to submit a Practical Exam based on a mock business problem. The prompt for my project was to build a model for Tasty Bytes, an online platform that shares recipes with its audience and offers subscription boxes to customers who want to receive pre-measured ingredients for the recipes delivered to their doorstep. Tasty Bytes posts a different recipe to their home page every day, and they have found that popular recipes can increase traffic to other parts of their website by as much as 40%, directly affecting subscriptions. My job was to build a model that could predict which recipes, when posted to the company's home page, would lead to high website traffic.

This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis with data visualization, pre-processing, and building and testing machine learning models. Please also see Tasty Bytes Slides.pptx, which I used to give a 10 minute presentation explaining my findings of my analysis to the company's product manager and other non-technical stakeholders.
